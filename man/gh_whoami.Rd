\title{Info on current GitHub user and token}
\usage{
gh_whoami(.token = NULL, .api_url = NULL, .send_headers = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{.token}{Authentication token.}

\item{.api_url}{Github API url (default: \url{https://api.github.com}).
Used if \code{endpoint} just contains a path.}

\item{.send_headers}{Named character vector of header field values
(excepting \code{Authorization}, which is handled via
\code{.token}). This can be used to override or augment the
defaults, which are as follows: the \code{Accept} field defaults
to \code{"application/vnd.github.v3+json"} and the
\code{User-Agent} field defaults to
\code{"https://github.com/r-pkgs/gh"}. This can be used
to, e.g., provide a custom media type, in order to access a
preview feature of the API.}
}
\value{
A \code{gh_response} object, which is also a \code{list}.
}
\description{
Reports wallet name, GitHub login, and GitHub URL for the current
authenticated user, the first few and last characters of the token, and the
associated scopes.
}
\details{
Get a personal access token for the GitHub API from
\url{https://github.com/settings/tokens} and select the scopes necessary for
your planned tasks. The \code{repo} scope, for example, is one many are
likely to need. The token itself is a string of 40 letters and digits. You
can store it any way you like and provide explicitly via the \code{.token}
argument to \code{\link{gh}()}.

However, many prefer to define an environment variable \code{GITHUB_PAT} (or
\code{GITHUB_TOKEN}) with this value in their \code{.Renviron} file. Add a
line that looks like this, substituting your PAT:

\preformatted{
GITHUB_PAT=8c70fd8419398999c9ac5bacf3192882193cadf2
}

Put a line break at the end! If youâ€™re using an editor that shows line
numbers, there should be (at least) two lines, where the second one is empty.
Restart R for this to take effect. Call \code{gh_whoami()} to confirm
success.

To get complete information on the authenticated user, call
\code{gh("/user")}.

For token management via API (versus the browser), use the
\href{https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth_authorizations/}{OAuth
Authorizations API}. This API requires Basic Authentication using your
username and password, not tokens, and is outside the scope of the \code{gh}
package.
